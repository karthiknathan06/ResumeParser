# ResumeParser

# Problem statement
In today's economy, you need to carefully present your experience to avoid being seen as unstable.Hence a resume play a important part for a employer perspective. Similarly a HR of a company can receive up to 100 resumes per day i.e 100*365=36500 per/yr.
Whenever the company need to recruit members, he should process and sort those resumes which will be an resource consuming job for a HR manager.

This requires a perfect resume classifier system which recommends candidates to HR based on different level of needs of company.This makes an hour of work done in 10 minutes.But the major issue before classifying is to process those resume in a structured manner.

# Automatic Resume Screening
Np need to deal with lot of resumes
Saves a ton of time.Companies spend over 23 hours in one job opening to scan resumes.
The quality of hire increases tremendously.


# Named Entity Recognition
Resume parsing through Name entity recognition:
Named-entity recognition (NER) (also known as entity identification, entity chunking and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entity mentions in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as the person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

# Spacy:
Processing raw text intelligently is difficult: most words are rare, and it's common for words that look completely different to mean almost the same thing. The same words in a different order can mean something completely different. Even splitting text into useful word-like units can be difficult in many languages. While it's possible to solve some problems starting from only the raw characters, it's usually better to use linguistic knowledge to add useful information. That's exactly what spaCy is designed to do: you put in raw text, and get back a labelled object, that comes with a variety of annotations.
